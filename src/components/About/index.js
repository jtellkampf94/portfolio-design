      <p>
        Hi, I'm Jonathan, a full stack web developer based in the North London
        area. I specialize in JavaScript / TypeScript technologies but have also
        worked with PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases. I am passionate about
        coding and enjoy both sides of the stack, from designing and adding UI
        effects on the frontend, to creating GraphQL servers or REST API's on
        the backend.
      </p>

      <p>
        I can help you create cost effective digital products that solve
        business and customer needs. I am adaptable and willing to learn outside
        my scope of knowledge produce solutions for you.
      </p>
