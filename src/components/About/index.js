          Hi, I'm Jonathan Tellkampf, a full stack web developer based in the
          North London area. I predominantly work with technologies that use
          JavaScript, TypeScript and SQL programming languages. I am passionate
          about coding and can work on both sides of the stack, from building UI
          components on the front end, to implementing server side functionality
          on the back end.
        </p>

        <p>
          I can help you create cost effective digital products that solve
          business and customer needs. I am adaptable and willing to learn
          outside my scope of knowledge to produce solutions for you.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>
