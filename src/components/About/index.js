        Hi, I'm Jonathan, a full stack web developer based in the North London
        area. I specialize in JavaScript / TypeScript technologies but have also
        worked with PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases. I am passionate about
        coding and enjoy both sides of the stack, from designing and adding UI
        effects on the frontend to creating GraphQL servers or REST API's on the
        backend. I am always love creating digital products that solve your
        needs
